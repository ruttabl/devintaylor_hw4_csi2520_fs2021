                <h3>The video above is a really powerful one. It goes to show how long people will try to accomplish
                    something even with no clear goal in sight. The game they are playing was created by someone with one goal in mind; to waste other
                    peoples time. They log into the custom map and are supposedly trying to solve a riddle, and when the riddle is solved they are allowed access
                    to the theme park that is visible from inside. However there is nothing out there other than a JPEG of a ferris wheel, and the 
                    riddle is nonsense. There is no escaping from Mr. Bone's chamber. Some thought can really be put behind why these strangers on the internet
                    are so invested into a farse, what are yours?
